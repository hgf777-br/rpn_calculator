# RPN Calculator

I developed this RPN calculator to use in windows because I love RPN's and can't find one beatifull and easy to use as the one I have in my android. I use RealCalc in the Android, for a long time, and used it as a base to mine. So all my thanks to the RealCalc guys. Your calculator Rocks!!!

I used Python and PyQt6 for developing it and transformed it in a windows desktop program with pyinstaller.

In this first version I only put the regular functions I use and is pretty easy to use.

Maybe in the future I will enhance it. Or maybe someone else will...

## Install and use

1) If you only want to to use it in your windows, just download the [rpn setup](win_installer/rpn_setup.exe) file inside the [win_installer](win_installer) folder and double click it.
2) if you want to run as a python project, and maybe work on it:
